Airplanes have been a miracle in transportation for the past century or so, but we still have a persisting problem: 
How to efficiently board people into an airplane?
Hopefully with this kata we'll be able to solve this problem.

Having an airplane like:

| A | B | Row | C | D |
|---|---|-----|---|---|
| 1 | 1 |  -  | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |  -  | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |  -  | 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 |  -  | 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 |  -  | 5 | 5 |

We would like to find a way for sitting the passengers in the fastest way. That means the least amount of rounds possible.

Rules:

- The airplane is fully booked.
- The airplane can be entered from the front and from the back.
- All movements are done on individual rounds ( one movement per round ).
- Passengers can be sorted before boarding the plane.
- 2 people can occupy the same position in the corridor.
- Once a passenger finds the right row for their seat, they need 1 cycle to put their luggage in the overhead cabin.
- Once a passenger sits, that person can't move anymore.
