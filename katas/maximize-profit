# Story
Durance has been recruiting some allies to help him in missions, but recently, he's been having trouble deciding how to make the best use of his allies time. 
We should help them figure out how to make the most profit!

## Requirements
Write an algorithm that helps Durance maximize the use of his allies and resources so that they can profit the most. 
A mission can require more than 1 ally to complete and every ally requires a fee to help you!

### Rules
Every mission will require at least 1 ally
A mission may require a specific ally
You can use the same ally for a different mission, but you'll have to pay them again!

Let's say that there are 3 missions available:

| Mission profit | Ally cost | Requirement |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |
| 100 | 200 | Mission requires allies 1 and 2 |
| 200 | 100 | Mission requires ally 2 |
| 150 | 50 | Mission requiers ally 3 |

The maximum amount we can spend is 250
