# Story
Durance got tired of learning spells and sorting bags and decided to invest in papicoins, the newest cryptocurrency (we don't judge). In order to do so, he has to learn how to read the records of transactions. Durance promised us a percentage of the profits so let's help!

## Description
Create an application that helps Durance read the transactions of the cryptocurrency. \
The transactions are arithmetic operations wrapped by parentheses.

## Rules
 - All of the operations are wrapped in a parentheses
 - There is an even number of parentheses

## Examples:
```
( 1 + ( ( 2 + 3 ) * (4 * 5) ) ) -> 101
( 5 ( 4 ( 3 ( 2 ( 1 * 9 ) / 8 - 7 ) + 6 ) ) ) -> -165
3 + ( 2 * 1 ) -> Invalid
```
